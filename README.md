COMP2659_Project
Game for the Atari ST
Title: Mallard ShootOut
Authors: Jaunie W. & Edward M.

After running make, two test executables should be made:

Running "tst_all" will render bitmaps and allow the user to track
x & y values of the reticle and the mallards as well as count down
the in-game clock.

Running "tst_rend" shows the frame by frame rendering in action.

Running "tst_rast" will allow the user to flip through pre-programmed
frames.
