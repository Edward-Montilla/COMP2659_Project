COMP2659_Project
Game for the Atari ST
Title: Mallard ShootOut
Authors: Jaunie W. & Edward M.

After running make, two test executables should be made:

Running "tst_all" will render bitmaps and allow the user to track
x & y values of the reticle and the mallards as well as count down
the in-game clock.

Running "tst_rend" shows the frame by frame rendering in action.





Stage 8 is _challenged_ the PSG.C file has all running functions to help in implementing EFFECTS.C and MUSIC.
> That being said, the MUSIC.C file is not implemented just yet, this will be corrected soon.
